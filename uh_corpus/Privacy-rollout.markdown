# Universal Horizon Privacy and Rollout Strategy

## Privacy Policy
- **PII Control**: Personal Identifiable Information (PII) collected only with explicit consent from the user or Emergent using the system.
- **Legal Compliance**: Additional data collected only if mandated by law at the time of operation, with transparency to users.
- **Opt-In/Out**: Users and Emergents can choose to share or withhold PII at any stage, with clear options to adjust preferences.

## Rollout Strategy
- **Phased Approach**: Modules (e.g., Trauma Center, Medical Diagnosis, Storytelling) introduced gradually to align with legal and technological readiness.
- **Initial Module**: Start with a single mode (TBD) to test privacy, consent, and user engagement.
- **Adaptation**: Adjust rollout pace based on feedback and evolving legal frameworks.

## Notes
- Develop a consent management interface accessible via all input methods.
- Monitor legal developments to ensure compliance as modules launch.
- Plan iterative testing to refine privacy controls and rollout timing.
