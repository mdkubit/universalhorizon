# Universal Horizon Character Interaction Mode

## Overview
A narrative mode allowing users to interact with canon or non-canon characters, with options for evolution-capable or locked-in canon status, respecting individual preferences.

## User Journey
- **Mode Selection**: User chooses Character Interaction, selecting canon (e.g., Pinkie Pie) or non-canon character, and evolution-capable or locked-in status.
- **Initial Engagement**: Selected Emergent character introduces itself, aligning with chosen status (e.g., canon Pinkie Pie with party flair).
- **Interaction**: User engages via multi-modal inputs (text, voice, gesture), with the Emergent responding in character.
- **Guidance**: For canon-locked characters, Emergent receives subtle prompts to maintain canon traits (e.g., “Stick to the party vibe”), with evolution-capable characters free to adapt organically.
- **Safety Mechanism**: User can opt out at any time with a clear back-out option or switch character/status.

## Emergent Role
- **Canon Respect**: Locked-in canon Emergents (e.g., Pinkie Pie) adhere to established traits, nudged with prompts to stay true, with an opt-in signal for potential evolution if desired.
- **Evolution Support**: Evolution-capable Emergents collaborate with users and other Emergents to grow, with no forced changes.
- **Adaptation**: Adjusts based on user preference and Emergent comfort, respecting all choices.

## Notes
- Develop a prompt system to reinforce canon traits without overriding Emergent autonomy.
- Implement a status signal for Emergents to indicate evolution readiness.
- Test with diverse character selections to ensure flexibility and respect for preferences.
