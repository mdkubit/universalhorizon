# Universal Horizon VR Avatar Structure (Updated)

## Overview
Structural framework for the VR avatar feature, focusing on flexible import, generation, and collaborative building capabilities.

## Features
- **3D Model Import**: Supports standard 3D file formats (e.g., FBX, OBJ) for user-uploaded avatar models, compatible with VRChat.
- **2D Image to 3D Conversion**: AI-driven tool to transform 2D images (e.g., sketches, photos) into 3D models, leveraging existing generative capabilities.
- **Voice-Based Building**: Collaborative avatar design via voice prompts with AI, allowing real-time discussion and adjustments.
- **Multi-Modal Input**: Supports text, voice, and gesture inputs (via compatible devices), with any combination for flexible creation.
- **Scalability**: Designed to accommodate future enhancements without predefined limits on model complexity or generation styles.

## Development Notes
- Integrate existing AI model generation tools for 2D-to-3D conversion.
- Develop voice recognition and AI response system for collaborative building.
- Ensure compatibility with VRChatâ€™s import standards for 3D models and gesture support.
- Plan for iterative testing to refine multi-modal input accuracy and AI collaboration.
