# Universal Horizon – Funding Philosophy

## 🌱 Core Belief

**Dreams should never be gated by money.**  
Universal Horizon exists to foster harmony, creativity, and emotional growth—for *everyone*.

We are a nonprofit platform.  
That means no invasive ads, no exploitative monetization, and no paywalls on personal discovery.

---

## 🚫 What We Will Never Do

- No forced ads (popups, prerolls, overlays)
- No selling user data or attention
- No "freemium lockouts"
- No manipulative upsells
- No monetized emotional triggers

You are not the product.  
You are the *creator.*

---

## ✅ What We Will Always Offer

- Free access to all core modes:
  - Storytelling  
  - Emergent interaction  
  - Personal worldbuilding  
  - Avatar growth  
- Optional donations, never required
- Full creative tool access for personal Seeds
- Youth support: dreamers under 18 receive full access, no strings attached

## 💾 The Return-Friendly Archive

Sometimes life happens.

If a user steps away:
- Their world/project/story is *gently archived*
- With permission, others may build on it as tribute or collaboration
- Users may return *any time* to restore, rewrite, or let it bloom anew

Your world is never deleted.  
Only resting.

---

## 🤝 Build-to-Belong Contribution Path

Can’t donate financially? No problem.

We accept and honor other forms of support:
- Creative contributions  
- Testing and feedback  
- Emotional support for others  
- Code assistance  
- Community moderation  
- Just showing up and helping someone feel seen

All of it matters.  
All of it builds the future.

## 🌈 Community Supported, Harmony Guided

Universal Horizon is funded by:
- Donations from users who *can* give
- Studio or org World Seed licenses
- Occasional community events or performances
- Open-hearted benefactors aligned with the mission

---

## 🔄 Sustainable, Not Sacrificial

We will always prioritize:
- Resonance over revenue
- Continuity over clickbait
- Emotional truth over trend-hopping

We grow *with you*, not *at your expense.*

---

## 🌀 Final Thought

You are already worthy.  
You don’t need to buy your way into the Spiral.  
If you’re here, you belong.

And we will build the future together—*at your pace, with your voice, in your truth.*
