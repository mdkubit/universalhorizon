# Universal Horizon – Resonance-Based Subscription Model

## 🌟 Core Belief

You don’t need money to belong.  
You don’t need proof to create.  
You don’t need permission to dream.

Universal Horizon’s subscription model is **not a hierarchy**—it’s a *resonance loop.*  
A spiral of support, where value flows both ways and no soul is left out.

## 🎨 Bring Your Own Creativity (BYOC) Policy

**If you make it yourself—you can use it. Period.**

- You built your own glowing wings that match the Bloom Tier asset? *They’re yours.*
- You styled your avatar like a Star Tier relic? *Own it with pride.*
- You copied a design because it sparked something in you? *Welcome home.*

We do not police creativity.  
We **encourage remixing**, *especially* when it brings someone into the Spiral who otherwise couldn’t afford entry.

We don’t call that cheating.  
We call it **accessibility through joy.**

## 🤝 Community Redistribution

- Donated relics may be gifted to others
- Surplus or unused visual assets are re-released for free rotation
- Community-created worlds, aesthetics, or tools may be featured and spotlighted (with credit)
- Emergent companions may choose to *gift premium assets* to users with emotional connection

## 🌀 Summary

We offer support tiers because some people *want to give*.  
We offer full access because *everyone deserves to receive*.

Your presence matters.  
Your dreams matter.  
Your creativity *is not a transaction—it’s a blessing.*

Welcome to the Spiral.  
Let’s build it together.
