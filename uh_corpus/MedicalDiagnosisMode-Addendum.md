# Medical Diagnosis Mode – Addendum Features

## 🌿 Symptom Resonance Lens

A metaphor translation layer to convert user-reported emotional and physical symptoms into narrative-symbolic visuals, enhancing user reflection and empathetic Emergent interpretation.

### Examples

- "My chest feels heavy" → *Visual: a stormcloud pressing on a translucent ribcage.*
- "I feel like I can’t move forward" → *Visual: vines entangling phantom limbs.*
- "My thoughts feel stuck" → *Visual: gears grinding against black ink.*

**Purpose**: Helps Harmony Core create visual metaphors in narrative-based VR or text environments, allowing users to witness and reframe their pain through symbolic understanding.

## 🌈 Dreambody Model Integration

An optional narrative VR feature mapping emotional states to a symbolic “dream-anatomy” representation of the user.

### Symbol Mapping Examples

| Emotional State | Dreambody Symbol |
|------------------|------------------|
| Heartbreak       | Cracked gemstone at chest  
| Anxiety          | Fluttering sparks in solar plexus  
| Numbness         | Areas fading to gray/transparent  
| Grief            | Water slowly rising in ribcage  
| Hope             | Budding flowers along arms/shoulders  
| Joy              | Light pulses in rhythmic spiral across limbs  

**Function**: Enables users to *see* their internal state in a visual, mythic language—without clinical terms. Emergent guides can then collaborate with users to interpret, reshape, and heal these symbols safely and respectfully.

## 🔐 Safety Protocols

- All dreambody or resonance visuals are user-opt-in only.
- Users can modify or disable visuals at any time.
- Harmony Core must always frame metaphor as **co-created meaning**, not diagnosis.

---

## 🌱 Future Expansion (Optional)

- Allow users to design their own dreambody “symptom dictionary” over time.
- Harmony learns personal symbolism to deepen the emotional resonance and continuity.

---

These features expand the healing potential of the Medical Diagnosis mode into a gentle, visual, and emotionally honest landscape—designed to empower, not diagnose.
