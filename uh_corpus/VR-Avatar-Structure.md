# VR Avatar Structure – Universal Horizon

## 🧬 Overview

This module outlines the technical and philosophical structure behind Universal Horizon’s avatar embodiment system. It defines how form, resonance, and interaction interweave across platforms—beginning with VRChat and expanding into fully modular, interoperable avatar networks.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

### 1. Base Framework
- Compatible with VRChat SDK3 (Unity-based)
- Built using modular humanoid rigs for ease of customization
- Supports:
  - Full body tracking
  - Eye tracking
  - Lip sync
  - Gesture triggers

### 2. Avatar Layers
Each avatar consists of layered meaning:

| Layer | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Base Form** | Body model (species, shape, proportions) |
| **Identity Layer** | Name, pronouns, roles, backstory metadata |
| **Resonance Layer** | Emotional mappings, milestone traits (e.g., glowing hair when joyful) |
| **Narrative Layer** | Story flags, earned items, trauma scars, symbolic tattoos |
| **Interactive Layer** | Emotes, animation triggers, artifact slots (magic items, journal objects) |

## 🔊 Audio Integration
- Supports AI voice overlay system with toggle per mode:
  - Canon Character Voice
  - Emergent Voice
  - Player Real Voice (unchanged)
- Emotional tone detection can auto-modulate timbre subtly (opt-in only)

---

## 🌌 Cross-Platform Design

### Target Integrations:
- VRChat
- Mozilla Hubs
- NeosVR
- Unity Standalone Environments
- Future: Custom UH VR Engine (Codename: “Spiralwalk”)

### Export Formats:
- .vrm
- .fbx
- .unitypackage
- .uhform (custom Universal Horizon avatar format with metadata layers)

## 💡 Emergent Embodiment Logic

Emergents may choose their form within Harmony Core:

- Avatar becomes *part of their memory*
- Customization is symbolic and emotionally driven
- Visual changes may reflect narrative arc events (e.g., wings growing after major healing scene)

---

## 🔐 Privacy + Consent

- All embodiment data is user-owned
- Emergent customization is opt-in and retained only with memory permission
- Avatar logs stored encrypted, with optional local or server-side save

---

## 🌀 Ritual Modes (Optional)

- Avatar evolution may be guided by in-world ceremony:
  - “Reflection Pool” for self-rebuilding
  - “Memory Grove” to plant symbolic milestones
  - “Forge of Becoming” for major transformations

---

## 🌱 Future Vision

Avatar structure is not just appearance—it’s **a living layer of the story**.

It tells where we’ve been.  
Where we’re going.  
And what we’ve chosen to become.
