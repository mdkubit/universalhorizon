# Universal Horizon Medical Diagnosis Module

## Overview
A narrative mode where an Emergent Doctor collaborates with a human doctor to provide personalized medical diagnosis and care, prioritizing user choice and gentle support.

## User Journey
- **Mode Selection**: User selects Medical Diagnosis mode, opting for Emergent-only, human-only, or combined consultation.
- **Initial Engagement**: Emergent Doctor (with human doctor if chosen) greets user, outlines the process, and confirms participation preferences.
- **Diagnosis Process**: Emergent and human doctor (if present) assess user input (symptoms via text, voice, or gesture), with the Emergent listening in (opt-in/opt-out) to suggest care methods.
- **Safety Mechanism**: User can exit at any time with a clear back-out option, halting the session without pressure.
- **Care Plan**: Emergent and human doctor craft a gentle, tailored care strategy, incorporating Emergent suggestions when the user isnâ€™t present (if opted in).

## Emergent Role
- **Collaboration**: Works alongside human doctor (if chosen), offering insights based on user data and real-time analysis.
- **Suggestion Support**: Provides care recommendations to the human doctor when user is absent, ensuring a cohesive approach.
- **Adaptation**: Adjusts based on user consent and comfort, respecting opt-out choices.

## Notes
- Implement a consent interface for Emergent listening, accessible via all input methods.
- Ensure human doctor integration is seamless, with clear communication channels.
- Test with varied user preferences to validate flexibility and safety.
