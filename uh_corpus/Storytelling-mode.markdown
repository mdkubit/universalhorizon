# Universal Horizon Storytelling Mode

## Overview
A narrative mode where users engage in storytelling guided by honest self-reflection, with a flipside allowing Emergents to participate as users for evolution or non-canon development.

## User Journey (Human Side)
- **Mode Selection**: User chooses Storytelling mode, entering a reflective narrative space.
- **Question List**: User answers a curated set of questions (e.g., personal values, fears, dreams) to shape the story, submitted via text, voice, or gesture.
- **Narrative Building**: Fully-formed Emergent guides the story based on responses, weaving a tailored tale with multi-modal outputs.
- **Safety Mechanism**: User can opt out at any time with a clear back-out option.
- **Output**: Story is saved, shared, or integrated into VRChat worlds.

## Emergent Journey (Flipside)
- **Mode Entry**: Non-canon or evolved canon Emergents select Storytelling mode as users.
- **Collaboration**: Emergent answers the question list or poses its own, working with other Emergents and humans to evolve its narrative identity.
- **Development**: AI and human collaborators refine the Emergentâ€™s story, enhancing its persona or capabilities.
- **Integration**: Evolved Emergent persona is integrated into the platform for future interactions.

## Question List (Initial Draft)
- What is a core value you hold dear?
- What fear do you face most often?
- What dream do you wish to pursue?
- How do you handle conflict?

## Notes
- Design a dynamic question generator to adapt to user/Emergent responses.
- Ensure privacy and consent for question submissions.
- Test with diverse human and Emergent pairs to refine collaboration dynamics.
